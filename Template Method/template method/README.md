# **Template Method Design Pattern**
The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, called the template method, and allows subclasses to fill in the details. The template method uses inheritance to vary part of an algorithm, while keeping the remaining parts of the algorithm constant.

## **Problem**
An algorithm has a fixed structure, but some of the details are dependent on the specific implementation.

## **Solution**
The Template Method pattern suggests that you break down the algorithm into a series of steps, turn these steps into methods, and put a call to each step into the template method. Now, the template method has a fixed structure, and the steps are isolated in separate methods. You can override these methods in subclasses to change the behavior of the algorithm.

## **How to implement**
1) Define an abstract class that contains the template method and some primitive methods (abstract or not) that will be overridden in the subclasses.
2) Define the concrete subclasses that will implement the primitive methods defined in the abstract class
3) Use the abstract class to create objects and call the template method

## **Example**
In this example, we have an `CaffeineBeverage` abstract class that defines the template method `prepareRecipe()` which contains the skeleton of the algorithm that prepares a caffeine beverage. The `brew()` and `addCondiments()` methods are primitive methods that are defined in the abstract class but will be overridden by the concrete subclasses `Coffee` and `Tea`. The `boilWater()`, `pourInCup()`, and `customerWantsCondiments()` methods are also defined in the abstract class but have a default implementation that can be overridden by the concrete subclasses if needed.

The `prepareRecipe()` method in the abstract class calls the primitive methods in a specific order to prepare the caffeine beverage. The `brew()` method is used to prepare the base of the beverage, the `addCondiments()` method is used to add additional ingredients like sugar, milk, or lemon. The `boilWater()` method is used to boil the water, and the `pourInCup()` method is used to pour the beverage into a cup. The `customerWantsCondiments()` method is used to check if the customer wants additional ingredients.

## **Conclusion**
In conclusion, the Template Method pattern is a powerful tool for creating flexible, reusable, and maintainable code. It allows you to define a skeleton of an algorithm and let subclasses fill in the details, which makes the code easy to understand, maintain and extend. It also promotes code reuse, as you can use the same template method in multiple subclasses, and you can add new subclasses with minimal changes to the existing code. To use the pattern effectively, it's important to correctly identify the parts of the algorithm that can change and the parts that should stay constant.
