# **Interpreter Design Pattern**
The interpreter pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a language and provides an interpreter for that language. It is used to define a language and then use that language to solve a problem.

## **Problem**
Consider a scenario where you have a complex problem that can be broken down into smaller and simpler problems. You want to define a language to represent the problem and then use that language to solve the problem. However, the problem is too complex to be solved using a single, monolithic piece of code.

## **Solution**
The interpreter design pattern provides a solution to this problem by defining a language and providing an interpreter for that language. The interpreter is responsible for taking the language and using it to solve the problem.

The interpreter pattern consists of three main components:

1) The **Expression** interface defines the interface for all expressions in the language.

2) The **ConcreteExpression** classes implement the Expression interface and define the behavior for different types of expressions in the language.

3) The **Interpreter** class is responsible for interpreting the language and using it to solve the problem.

## **Example**
In our example code, we have implemented the Interpreter pattern to evaluate mathematical expressions. We have created classes for different mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each class implements the Expression interface which has one method interpret() which calculates the value of the expression.

We also have a class Evaluator that takes a string as input which contains the mathematical expression and it tokenizes the string and pushes the numbers on the stack and when it finds an operator, it pops the last two numbers from the stack, applies the operator and pushes the result back on the stack. Finally, it returns the result which is the final value on the top of the stack.

In this way, we can interpret any mathematical expression provided in the form of a string. This pattern can also be used for other types of languages such as SQL, regular expressions, and so on.

## **Conclusion**
In conclusion, the Interpreter pattern is a powerful tool for creating languages and interpreting them. It allows for a simple and elegant solution to a complex problem, by breaking it down into smaller, simpler parts. It's a pattern that is widely used in the industry and is a must-know for any software engineer.
