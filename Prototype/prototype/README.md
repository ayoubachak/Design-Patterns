# **Prototype Design Pattern**
The Prototype design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for creating new objects by copying existing objects (prototypes) rather than creating new objects from scratch. It involves implementing a Cloneable interface, which defines a clone() method for creating a copy of an object.

## **Problem the pattern is solving**
Creating new objects can be expensive, especially if they are complex or require a lot of resources. The Prototype pattern allows for creating new objects by copying existing ones, which can be more efficient and less resource-intensive.

## **Introducing the Solution**
The prototype pattern consists of a Prototype interface that defines the clone() method, and a ConcretePrototype class that implements the Prototype interface and provides the actual implementation for creating a copy of an object.

## **Explanation with the code**
Here's an example of how the Prototype pattern can be used to create a copy of an Employee object:
```java
interface Employee extends Cloneable {
    Employee clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;
    String getName();
    void setName(String name);
}

class ConcreteEmployee implements Employee, Cloneable {
    private String name;
    public ConcreteEmployee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
        public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Employee clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        ConcreteEmployee employee = new ConcreteEmployee(this.name);
        return employee;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            ConcreteEmployee original = new ConcreteEmployee("John Doe");
            Employee copy = original.clone();
            copy.setName("Jane Doe");
            System.out.println("Original: " + original.getName());
            System.out.println("Copy: " + copy.getName());
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, we have a Employee interface that extends the Cloneable interface and defines the clone() method and the ConcreteEmployee class that implements the Employee interface and provides the actual implementation for creating a copy of an object.

In the main class, we create an instance of ConcreteEmployee with the name "John Doe", and then use the clone() method to create a copy of this object, which we set the name "Jane Doe" . We can then print the original and the copy's name to see the result of the cloning process.

## **Real-world applications**
The Prototype pattern is often used in cases where creating a new object from scratch is expensive or time-consuming, for example, when creating a new object requires costly or complex operations like connecting to a database or calling an external service. Instead of creating a new object from scratch, we can create a copy of an existing object, which is much faster and less resource-intensive.

Another real-world application of the Prototype pattern is in the field of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries, where it is used to create new objects from database records.

Additionally, the Prototype pattern can be used in cases where the class of an object is unknown or needs to be selected at runtime. By creating a prototype of each possible class, and then creating a new object by copying the appropriate prototype, the class of the object can be selected at runtime.

## **Conclusion**
The Prototype design pattern is a powerful tool for creating new objects by copying existing ones, which can be more efficient and less resource-intensive than creating new objects from scratch. It's important to implement the Cloneable interface, which defines the `clone()` method and handle the CloneNotSupportedException in the implementation of the clone method.
