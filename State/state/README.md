# **State Design Pattern**
## **Introduction**
The State design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to change its behavior based on its internal state. It encapsulates the state-specific behavior and transitions between states in separate classes, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.

## **Example**
In the example above, we have a `VendingMachine` class that can be in one of four states: `NoCoin`, `HasCoin`, `Sold`, and `SoldOut`. Each state has its own behavior for handling actions such as inserting a coin, ejecting a coin, turning the crank, and dispensing a product.

When a user interacts with the `VendingMachine`, it delegates the actions to its current state. For example, when a user inserts a coin, the `VendingMachine` calls the `insertCoin()` method on its current state. The `NoCoinState`, for example, would transition to the `HasCoinState` when a coin is inserted.

We also have four State classes that implements the State interface, each one of them handle the specific behavior for each state.

## **Advantages**
The State design pattern allows for a clean separation of concerns and makes it easy to add new states or change the behavior of existing states without having to make changes to the `VendingMachine` class.

It is commonly used in cases where an object's behavior is determined by its internal state, and the behavior changes frequently or needs to be encapsulated from the rest of the application.

The main advantage of using the State design pattern is that it allows you to move the behavior associated with a particular state into a separate class. This promotes loose coupling between the state-specific behavior and the object that holds the state. This makes it easier to add new states, change the behavior of existing states, or even remove states without affecting the rest of the application.

In addition, it also allows you to encapsulate the state transitions, which makes the code more readable and maintainable.

## **How to use**
To use the State design pattern, you need to define the interface for the state and create concrete classes that implement the interface. In addition, you need to have a reference to the current state in the object that needs to change its behavior. Finally, you need to handle the state transitions in the object that holds the state.

## **Conclusion**
The State design pattern is a powerful tool for managing state-dependent behavior in objects. It promotes loose coupling between the state-specific behavior and the object that holds the state, making it easy to add, change or remove states without affecting the rest of the application. With the State pattern, you can encapsulate the state-specific behavior and transitions in separate classes, making the code more organized, readable, and maintainable.

In summary, the State pattern is a great choice when:

An object should change its behavior when its internal state changes.
Operations have large, multipart conditional statements that depend on the object's state.
Different states have different behavior, and state-specific behavior should be encapsulated in separate classes.
It is important to note that, as with any design pattern, it's important to use it when it makes sense for the problem you're trying to solve. As always, you should evaluate whether the added complexity of using the pattern is worth the benefits it provides.
