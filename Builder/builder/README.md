# **Builder Design pattern**
The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that provides a way to create complex objects step by step through a fluent interface. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing for the same construction process to create different representations.

## **Problem**
Creating complex objects can be a tedious and error-prone process, especially when the object has many optional or variable parts. The process of creating such objects often involves multiple constructors, setter methods, and a lot of conditional logic. This can lead to code that is hard to understand, maintain, and extend.

## **Solution**
The Builder design pattern solves this problem by separating the construction of an object from its representation. The object is constructed step by step through a fluent interface, which allows for a clear separation of concerns between the object's construction and its representation. This makes the code more readable, maintainable, and extensible.

## **Example**
In our example, we implemented the Builder pattern to create a car object. The car object has several optional and variable parts such as the engine, transmission, and wheels. The Builder interface provides a fluent interface for creating a car object step by step. The client code can use the Builder to create a car object with any combination of parts.

## **Real-world Applications**
* The Builder pattern is commonly used in the construction of complex objects in object-oriented programming. For example, it is used in the construction of GUI widgets, documents, and other complex objects.
* It's also used in the construction of 3D models and scenes in video games and computer-aided design software.
* It's also used in the construction of Web pages, and other types of web applications

## **Advantages**
* It separates the construction of an object from its representation, making the code more readable, maintainable, and extensible.
* It allows for the same construction process to create different representations of an object.
* It allows for the creation of complex objects step by step through a fluent interface.

## **Disadvantages**
* It can result in more verbose and complex code, especially when the object has many optional or variable parts.

## **Conclusion**
The Builder design pattern is a powerful and flexible creational pattern that can be used to create complex objects in a clear, readable, and extensible way. It is particularly useful when the object has many optional or variable parts, and when the construction process needs to be separated from the object's representation. By using the Builder pattern, you can create objects that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
